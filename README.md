# Broom
Game jam entry for the Mini Jam 74: Chaos.

Broom is my first public Github project, my first completed Godot project, and my first Mini Jam entry. (There's a first time for everything.)

This game was published 42 seconds before the jam closed!
The music was made within the last couple of hours by AnAaronBaron, but sadly, I was unable to add the credits music into the initial game.
This game got an overall ranking of 72 of 87 on Mini Jam 74: Chaos. (Pretty good for my first try.)

# Unused Content
The following content is in the project but not used in the final product because of time constraints: A couple of levels, credits music, and an enemy.

# Known Bugs
This game has numerous bugs when not played from the main scene due to the fact that I was a little short on time.
